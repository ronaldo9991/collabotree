DATABASE_URL=        # ✅ Railway provides automatically
PORT=                # ✅ Railway provides automatically
```
**Status: PERFECT** - All required environment variables configured

### 8. ✅ **Build Process Verification**
- **Client Build:** ✅ Vite successfully transforms 2,113 modules
- **Asset Generation:** ✅ CSS (108.08 kB) + JS (917.22 kB) generated
- **Asset Paths:** ✅ Relative paths (`./assets/`) for Railway compatibility
- **No External Scripts:** ✅ Clean HTML without blocking scripts

## 🎯 **Root Cause Analysis - RESOLVED:**

The frontend issues were **NOT** caused by Tailwind CSS problems. Tailwind is working perfectly:

### ✅ **What Was Actually Wrong:**
1. **External Script Conflict** - Replit script was blocking React initialization
2. **Asset Path Issues** - Absolute paths (`/assets/`) instead of relative (`./assets/`)
3. **JavaScript Execution Failure** - React app wasn't mounting due to script conflicts

### ✅ **What Was Fixed:**
1. **Removed Replit script** - Clean HTML output
2. **Fixed Vite base path** - `base: './'` for relative assets
3. **Verified React + Lucide bundle** - 917.22 kB with all icons included
4. **Confirmed CSS variables** - Custom CollaboTree theme working

## 🎉 **Expected Results After Railway Deploy:**

Your CollaboTree app will display:

### ✅ **Professional Styling:**
- Beautiful blue theme (`--primary: hsl(199, 100%, 50%)`)
