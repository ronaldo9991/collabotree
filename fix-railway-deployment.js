üöÄ RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT FIX SCRIPT
================================

This script will help you fix your Railway deployment issues.

CURRENT ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
‚ùå Database connection failing
‚ùå Environment variables not properly configured
‚ùå Backend not connecting to Railway PostgreSQL

SOLUTION STEPS:
`);

console.log(`
üìã STEP 1: SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES IN RAILWAY
===============================================

Go to your Railway dashboard and set these environment variables:

1. Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Click on your main service
4. Go to the "Variables" tab
5. Add these variables:

NODE_ENV=production
PORT=4000
CLIENT_ORIGIN=

# Use the DATABASE_URL from your Railway PostgreSQL service
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:lFUYCEkjTWZoeqofUFKaYnCWKlmIccCz@trolley.proxy.rlwy.net:50892/railway

# JWT Secrets (REQUIRED)
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=2cd6a98804511d307944b09a9b7d167f816f85d6c65d08aab123d03a34317b4d
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=4f550173cb97ce4e7f25fdbe2be0114c1066b8a115848d7659d82641ef9cee16
JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES_IN=15m
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
`);

console.log(`
üìã STEP 2: VERIFY RAILWAY POSTGRESQL SERVICE
============================================

1. In Railway dashboard, make sure you have a PostgreSQL service
2. The service should be named something like "PostgreSQL" or "Database"
3. Check that it's running (green status)
4. Copy the DATABASE_URL from the PostgreSQL service variables
`);

console.log(`
üìã STEP 3: REDEPLOY AFTER SETTING VARIABLES
===========================================

1. After setting all environment variables, Railway will automatically redeploy
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for the deployment to complete
3. Check the deployment logs for any errors
`);

console.log(`
üìã STEP 4: TEST THE DEPLOYMENT
==============================

Once deployed, test these endpoints:

1. Health Check: https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/health
2. Registration Test: https://your-app.up.railway.app/test-registration.html

Expected responses:
- Health check should return: {"status":"ok","environment":"production"}
- Registration should work without "Registration failed" error
`);

console.log(`
üîß TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES
================================

‚ùå "Database connection failed"
   ‚Üí Check DATABASE_URL is set correctly
   ‚Üí Verify PostgreSQL service is running in Railway

‚ùå "JWT_SECRET is required"
   ‚Üí Add JWT_ACCESS_SECRET and JWT_REFRESH_SECRET to Railway variables

‚ùå "Table 'users' doesn't exist"
   ‚Üí Database migrations will run automatically after fixing DATABASE_URL
   ‚Üí Check deployment logs for migration errors

‚ùå "Registration failed" still appears
   ‚Üí Check browser console for specific error messages
   ‚Üí Use the test-registration.html page to debug
`);

console.log(`
üìä EXPECTED RESULT AFTER FIX
============================

‚úÖ Backend should start successfully
‚úÖ Database connection should work
‚úÖ Registration should work without errors
‚úÖ Users can create accounts and log in
‚úÖ All API endpoints should respond correctly

üöÄ Your CollaboTree app should be fully functional!
`);

console.log(`
üÜò STILL HAVING ISSUES?
=======================

If problems persist:

1. Check Railway deployment logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure PostgreSQL service is running and accessible
4. Test the health endpoint to verify backend is running
5. Use the test-registration.html page to debug registration issues

The most common issue is missing or incorrect environment variables in Railway.
Make sure to set ALL the variables listed above!

üîç RAILWAY CLI DETECTED
======================

You have Railway CLI configured. You can also run:

railway status          # Check deployment status
railway logs            # View deployment logs
railway variables       # List environment variables
railway redeploy        # Force redeploy
