model Service {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  title         String
  description   String
  priceCents    Int
  coverImage    String?
  isActive      Boolean  @default(true)
  isTopSelection Boolean @default(false) // Added this field
  ownerId       String
  owner         User     @relation("ServiceOwner", fields: [ownerId], references: [id])
  hireRequests  HireRequest[]
  orders        Order[]
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime @updatedAt

  @@map("services")
}
```

### 2. **API Endpoints Fixed**
- ✅ Added public services endpoint (`/api/public/services`)
- ✅ Added public top selections endpoint (`/api/public/top-selections`)
- ✅ Fixed service creation endpoint (`/api/services`)
- ✅ Fixed chat endpoints (`/api/chat/rooms/:hireId/messages`)

### 3. **Authentication Fixed**
- ✅ Fixed JWT token validation
- ✅ Fixed Socket.IO authentication
- ✅ Fixed CORS configuration for production

### 4. **Chat System Fixed**
- ✅ Fixed Socket.IO connection issues
- ✅ Fixed chat room creation
- ✅ Fixed message sending and receiving
- ✅ Fixed real-time messaging

## 🚀 **Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Update Database Schema**
Run these commands in your Railway deployment:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Seed the database with sample data
npm run seed:railway
```

### **Step 2: Verify Environment Variables**
Ensure these are set in Railway:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=c98bb348ef74ffa759a63b552fdae9b0b0725c22966bb9a9dec91a25cad98451
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=d31c254f32c12ef1ca49e7d9d8c5ad9228ccaa2fead24625d8dfe00c76766a57
JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES_IN=15m
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
CLIENT_ORIGIN=
```

### **Step 3: Test All Functionality**

#### **Service Creation Test:**
1. Login as a student (alice@student.com / student123)
2. Go to "Create Service" page
3. Fill out the form and submit
4. Should create service successfully

#### **Chat System Test:**
1. Login as a buyer (charlie@buyer.com / buyer123)
2. Go to a service and click "Hire"
3. Send a hire request
4. Login as the student and accept the request
5. Chat should work in real-time

#### **Homepage Test:**
1. Visit homepage
2. Should show "Top Selection" projects
3. Should display properly with images and descriptions

## 🔧 **Technical Fixes Applied**

### **1. Fixed Service Creation**
- ✅ Proper validation schemas
- ✅ Authentication middleware
- ✅ Database field mapping
- ✅ Error handling

### **2. Fixed Chat System**
- ✅ Socket.IO authentication
- ✅ Real-time messaging
- ✅ Chat room management
- ✅ Message persistence

### **3. Fixed API Endpoints**
- ✅ Public services endpoint
- ✅ Top selections endpoint
- ✅ Service CRUD operations
- ✅ Chat message endpoints

### **4. Fixed Database**
- ✅ Proper schema with all fields
- ✅ Sample data seeding
- ✅ Migration scripts
- ✅ Connection handling

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After applying these fixes:

### **✅ Service Creation:**
- Students can create services
- Services appear in marketplace
- Top selections appear on homepage

### **✅ Chat System:**
- Real-time messaging works
- Chat rooms are created automatically
- Messages persist in database

### **✅ Homepage:**
- Shows top selection projects
- Professional layout
- Working search and filters

### **✅ Marketplace:**
- All services visible
- Search and filtering work
- Hire request system works

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **If services still don't create:**
1. Check Railway logs for validation errors
2. Verify user is logged in as STUDENT role
3. Check database connection

### **If chat doesn't work:**
1. Check Socket.IO connection in browser console
2. Verify JWT token is valid
3. Check hire request is ACCEPTED status

### **If homepage is empty:**
1. Run the seed script: `npm run seed:railway`
2. Check database has services with `isTopSelection: true`
3. Verify API endpoint: `/api/public/top-selections`

## 📞 **Support**

If you're still having issues:
1. Check Railway logs for specific errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure database migrations ran successfully
4. Test API endpoints directly

All major backend issues have been identified and fixed. The system should now work completely! 🚀
