## 📋 Railway Deployment Steps

### 1. Create Railway Project

Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app) and:

1. Click **"New Project"**
2. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Choose: `ronaldo9991/collabotree`
4. Select branch: `main`

### 2. Configure Root Directory ⚠️ CRITICAL

In Railway Dashboard → Service Settings → Build:

```
Root Directory: collabotree-main/backend
```

**This is critical!** Without this, Railway won't find nixpacks.toml.

### 3. Add PostgreSQL Database

In your Railway project:

1. Click **"+ New"**
2. Select **"Database"** → **"PostgreSQL"**
3. Railway auto-links it to your service

### 4. Set Environment Variables

In Railway Dashboard → Service → Variables:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=<YOUR_SECRET_HERE>
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<YOUR_SECRET_HERE>
JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES_IN=15m
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
CLIENT_ORIGIN=
PORT=${{PORT}}
```

**Generate JWT secrets:**
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Run this command twice to get two different secrets.

### 5. Deploy!

Railway will automatically:
1. ✅ Detect nixpacks.toml
2. ✅ Install Node.js 18
3. ✅ Install backend dependencies
4. ✅ Build frontend (Vite)
5. ✅ Copy frontend to backend/dist
6. ✅ Generate Prisma client
7. ✅ Run database migrations
8. ✅ Build backend (TypeScript)
9. ✅ Start server: `node dist/server.js`

### 6. Access Your App

Once deployed (usually 3-5 minutes):

- **Frontend**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/`
- **API**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/`
- **Health**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/health`

## 🔍 What's Different from Other Platforms

### vs Vercel
- Railway handles BOTH frontend and backend in ONE deployment
- No need for separate frontend/backend deployments
- PostgreSQL included (Vercel requires separate DB)
- WebSocket support built-in (Vercel has limitations)

### vs Heroku
- Faster builds with Nixpacks
- Better free tier (Hobby plan)
- Modern infrastructure
- No dyno sleep issues

---

## 🐛 Known Issues (Not Blocking Deployment)

### Windows Build Warning
When running `test-railway-build.js` on Windows, you may see:
```
EPERM: operation not permitted (Prisma file rename)
```

**This is OK!** It's a Windows file locking issue. Railway (Linux) won't have this problem.

### Line Ending Warnings
Git warnings about LF → CRLF are cosmetic. Railway handles this automatically.
