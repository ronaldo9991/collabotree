# 🚨 Railway Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: "Registration failed" Error

Your CollaboTree application is successfully deployed and running, but users are getting a "Registration failed" error when trying to sign up.

## 🔍 Most Likely Causes

### 1. Missing Environment Variables
The most common cause is that the required environment variables haven't been set in Railway.

### 2. Database Not Migrated
The PostgreSQL database exists but doesn't have the required tables.

### 3. Database Connection Issues
The app can't connect to the PostgreSQL database.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Railway

1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Navigate to your project
3. Click on your main service: `zippy-nurturing-production.up.railway.app`
4. Go to the **Variables** tab
5. Add these environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=4000
CLIENT_ORIGIN=

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:lFUYCEkjTWZoeqofUFKaYnCWKlmIccCz@postgres-tz1x.railway.internal:5432/railway
DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL=postgresql://postgres:lFUYCEkjTWZoeqofUFKaYnCWKlmIccCz@trolley.proxy.rlwy.net:50892/railway

JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=2cd6a98804511d307944b09a9b7d167f816f85d6c65d08aab123d03a34317b4d
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=4f550173cb97ce4e7f25fdbe2be0114c1066b8a115848d7659d82641ef9cee16
JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES_IN=15m
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
```

### Step 2: Run Database Migrations

After setting the environment variables, Railway will automatically redeploy. The app should now be able to connect to the database and run migrations automatically.

### Step 3: Verify the Fix

1. Wait for Railway to finish redeploying (usually 2-3 minutes)
2. Go to your app: `zippy-nurturing-production.up.railway.app`
3. Try to register a new account
4. The "Registration failed" error should be gone

## 🔍 Alternative: Manual Migration (if needed)

If the automatic migration doesn't work, you can run migrations manually:

1. Go to Railway dashboard → Your service → **Deployments** tab
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Go to **Logs** tab
4. Look for any database connection errors

## 🚨 Common Error Messages and Solutions

### "Database connection failed"
- Check that DATABASE_URL is set correctly
- Verify PostgreSQL service is running in Railway

### "Table 'users' doesn't exist"
- Database migrations haven't run
- Set environment variables and redeploy

### "JWT_SECRET is required"
- JWT_ACCESS_SECRET and JWT_REFRESH_SECRET are missing
- Add them to Railway environment variables

### "Prisma client not generated"
- This should be automatic, but if it fails, check the build logs

## 📊 Expected Result

After fixing the issues:
- ✅ Registration should work without errors
- ✅ Users can create accounts successfully
- ✅ Login functionality should work
- ✅ Basic app features should be functional

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

If the problem persists:

1. **Check Railway Logs**: Go to your service → Deployments → Latest deployment → Logs
2. **Look for specific error messages** in the logs
3. **Verify database connectivity** by checking if the PostgreSQL service is running
4. **Test the health endpoint**: Visit `https://zippy-nurturing-production.up.railway.app/api/health`

## 📞 Quick Test

Once fixed, you should be able to:
1. Visit the app
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Fill in the registration form
4. Successfully create an account
5. Log in with the new account

**Status**: App is deployed and running, just needs environment variables and database setup! 🚀
