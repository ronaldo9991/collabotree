Fix padding and spacing across the entire CollaboTree website so it always looks correct on full-screen and smaller devices.

# Global Padding Rules
- Use a unified container system like the navbar spacing (logo + Hire Talent button).
- Container is centered and never touches screen edges.
- Horizontal padding:
  • Desktop (≥1280px): px-20
  • Tablet (≥768px): px-10
  • Mobile (<768px): px-6
- Vertical padding:
  • Section top/bottom: py-20 desktop, py-14 tablet, py-10 mobile
  • Inside cards: p-8 desktop, p-6 tablet, p-4 mobile
- Replace all `w-screen` with `w-full` so content stays inside padding.

# Navbar
- Keep current spacing between CollaboTree logo and “Hire Talent” button as baseline.
- Height fixed at 64px (h-16).
- Container uses same px values as above.

# Hero Section
- Grid gap: gap-12 desktop, gap-8 tablet, gap-6 mobile.
- Text block max-width: max-w-xl for readability.
- Ensure hero image respects container padding.

# Cards (Projects, Features, Pricing, Testimonials)
- Outer padding: use same container px values.
- Inner padding: p-8 desktop, p-6 tablet, p-4 mobile.
- Consistent gap-4 between card sections (title → desc → tags → meta → price bar).
- Price bar: full width inside card, padding px-5 py-3.

# Footer
- Horizontal padding matches navbar.
- Top padding: pt-20 desktop, pt-14 tablet, pt-10 mobile.
- Bottom padding: pb-10 all devices.
- Column gaps: gap-12 desktop, gap-8 tablet, gap-6 mobile.

# Responsive Adjustments
- Desktop: 3-column grids with gap-8
- Tablet: 2-column grids with gap-6
- Mobile: single column with gap-5
- Always reduce section paddings by ~30% on tablet and ~50% on mobile.

# Accessibility
- Ensure no content bleeds to the edge on any device.
- All focus states use ring-2 ring-blue-400.
- Max line width ~70 characters for readability.

# Goal
Make sure every page section, hero, card, and footer uses the **same horizontal and vertical padding system as the navbar baseline**, so the design looks consistent and professional at any screen size.
