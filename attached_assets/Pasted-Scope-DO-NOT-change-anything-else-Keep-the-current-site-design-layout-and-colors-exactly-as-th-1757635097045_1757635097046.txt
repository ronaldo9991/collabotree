Scope (DO NOT change anything else)
- Keep the current site design, layout, and colors exactly as they are.
- Implement ONLY:
  1) Sign-In Page + Sign-In Modal (same UI reused)
  2) CTA Popup for "Hire Talent" and "Join as Student"
  3) New dashboards for Student and Buyer (simple, minimal, matching existing style)

Design & Colors
- Reuse existing color tokens, typography, spacing, and components.
- No new color palette. No global style changes.

Routing (keep current scheme; add only these)
- /signin  (page)
- /dashboard/student
- /dashboard/buyer

Auth Flow (mockable)
- Sign-In supports email+password (and placeholder social buttons).
- On successful sign-in:
  - If user.role === "student" → redirect to /dashboard/student
  - If user.role === "buyer"   → redirect to /dashboard/buyer
- Provide a simple role switcher in dev mode (only visible if ENV DEV) to test redirects.

Components to Add (match existing cards/buttons)
1) SignInCard
   - Max width 420px, centered; same surface, border, radius, and shadow as current cards.
   - Fields: Email, Password, “Remember me”, “Forgot password?”
   - Buttons row: [Continue] (primary), secondary text link for “Create account”.
   - Small links under form:
       • “Continue as Buyer”
       • “Continue as Student”
   - Errors show inline under inputs (do not use toasts for basic errors).

2) SignInModal
   - Reuse SignInCard inside a modal.
   - Triggered from header “Sign In” button (open modal instead of navigating).
   - Modal has close (X), click-outside, Esc to close.
   - When submitted → same redirect logic as SignInCard.

3) CTA Popup (Hire Talent / Join as Student)
   - Modal with two large buttons:
       • Hire Talent → go to /signin (prefill role=buyer) or open SignInModal with role=buyer.
       • Join as Student → go to /signin (prefill role=student) or open SignInModal with role=student.
   - Include one line of helper text under each option.
   - Do not change header layout; just bind the existing “Hire Talent” and “Join as Student” buttons to open this popup.

Dashboards (keep minimal, same style)
4) StudentDashboard (/dashboard/student)
   - Page title: “Student Dashboard”
   - Row of 3 stat cards (match existing card style):
       • Active Projects • Messages • Payouts Pending
   - Two-column layout:
       • Left: “My Projects” table (Title · Buyer · Status · Budget · Due · Actions [View | Chat])
       • Right: “Messages” preview list (last 5 threads)
   - Primary action button at top-right: “Create Offer” (same button style as site).
   - Empty states use same card style and iconography as current site.

5) BuyerDashboard (/dashboard/buyer)
   - Page title: “Buyer Dashboard”
   - Row of 3 stat cards:
       • Active Orders • In Review • Amount Spent (MTD)
   - Two-column layout:
       • Left: “Orders” table (Project · Student · Status · Amount · Delivery · Actions [View | Chat | Approve])
       • Right: “Shortlisted” list (reuse existing project card style, compact)
   - Primary action button at top-right: “New Project Brief” → opens drawer with fields:
       • Title, Summary, Skills/Tags, Budget, Timeline, Attachments, Submit.

Behavior & UX (match existing site feel)
- Cards: same radius, border, shadow, padding as current project cards.
- Tables: compact rows; sticky header; small zebra tint (use existing neutrals).
- All modals/drawers:
   • Centered (modal) or right-sided (drawer), same blur/shadow style as existing overlays if any.
   • Focus-trap, Esc to close, click-outside to close.
- Buttons: reuse current primary/secondary classes; no new variants.
- Spacing: use the site’s current spacing scale; do not alter global paddings.

Data (sample/demo)
- Provide small mock arrays for projects, orders, messages to render lists/tables.
- Keep data in local state or a mock service; no external APIs required.

Acceptance Criteria
- Existing pages (Home, About, Explore Talent, How it Works, Footer) remain pixel-unchanged.
- Colors remain exactly the same.
- Header “Sign In” opens SignInModal; “Hire Talent” opens CTA Popup (with option to continue as Buyer).
- /signin works and redirects to the correct dashboard based on selected/returned role.
- /dashboard/student and /dashboard/buyer render with simple stat cards + table + messages list.
- Fully responsive (1 column on mobile; 2 columns on tablet/desktop).
- Keyboard accessible: Tab focus order, Enter submits, Esc closes modal, aria-labels set on dialogs.

Deliverables
- Components: SignInCard, SignInModal, CTAPopup, DrawerProjectBrief, StatCard, DataTable, MessagePreview.
- Routes/pages: /signin, /dashboard/student, /dashboard/buyer.
- Minimal mock data and role-based redirect logic.
