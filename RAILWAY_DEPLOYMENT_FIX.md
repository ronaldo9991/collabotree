# Railway Deployment Fix - Backend Issues

## Issues Identified
1. Backend server not starting properly
2. Database connection issues
3. Missing environment variables
4. Build process not optimized for Railway

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated nixpacks.toml
- Changed build command to use `railway:build` which includes both frontend and backend builds
- This ensures proper deployment of the full-stack application

### 2. Environment Variables Required
Set these in your Railway dashboard:

```bash
# Required Environment Variables
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@host:port/database
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=your-32-character-minimum-secret-key-here
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-another-32-character-minimum-secret-key-here
JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES_IN=15m
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
CLIENT_ORIGIN=
```

### 3. Database Setup
- Railway automatically provides DATABASE_URL when you add PostgreSQL
- Make sure PostgreSQL service is added to your Railway project
- The backend will automatically run migrations on startup

### 4. Build Process
The `railway:build` script:
1. Builds the frontend (React app)
2. Builds the backend (TypeScript compilation)
3. Runs Prisma migrations
4. Copies frontend build to backend dist folder

## Deployment Steps

1. **Add PostgreSQL to Railway**:
   - Go to your Railway project
   - Click "New" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
   - Railway will automatically set DATABASE_URL

2. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Go to your service settings
   - Add all required environment variables listed above
   - Generate strong JWT secrets (32+ characters)

3. **Deploy**:
   - Push your changes to trigger a new deployment
   - Railway will use the updated nixpacks.toml configuration

## Verification

After deployment, check:
1. Visit `https://your-app.railway.app/health` - should return API health status
2. Visit `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health` - should return API health status
3. Check Railway logs for any errors
4. Test the marketplace page - should load projects

## Troubleshooting

If still having issues:
1. Check Railway logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible
4. Check that the build process completed successfully
